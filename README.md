## CloudBridge: A Multicloud Integration Project

### Abstract

CloudBridge aims to seamlessly connect Azure Virtual Networks (VN) and AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) using VPNs, tunnels, and client gateways. This project ensures secure, efficient communication between different cloud environments, facilitating better collaboration and resource sharing.

### Introduction

Organizations often face challenges integrating services across different cloud platforms. Migrating to a single cloud environment can be costly and complex. CloudBridge addresses these issues by creating a secure "bridge" between Azure and AWS, enabling seamless data transfer and communication without the need for complete migration.

### Objective

The primary goals of CloudBridge are to:
- Establish secure, direct connections between Azure and AWS using VPNs and tunnels.
- Enhance data security with RSA encryption.
- Facilitate real-time network diagnostics and monitoring.

### Methodology

1. **Needs Analysis**: Identify requirements for integrating Azure and AWS environments.
2. **Cloud Environment Assessment**: Evaluate current configurations and identify areas for improvement.
3. **Infrastructure Setup**:
    - Create virtual networks in Azure and VPCs in AWS.
    - Deploy web applications on both platforms using Apache Tomcat.
4. **Security Management**: Implement encryption and access control measures.
5. **Network Diagnostics**: Integrate tools for real-time feedback and connection monitoring.
6. **Scalability Planning**: Ensure the architecture can handle future growth.
7. **Testing and Documentation**: Perform comprehensive tests and document the deployment process.

### Experimental Setup

1. **Azure Setup**:
    - Create and configure a virtual network.
    - Deploy a public VM instance with Apache Tomcat.
    - Configure a Virtual Network Gateway.
2. **AWS Setup**:
    - Create and configure a VPC.
    - Deploy a private VM instance with Apache Tomcat.
    - Configure a Customer Gateway.
3. **Cloud-Bridge Connection**:
    - Establish a VPN connection between Azure and AWS.
    - Implement security measures.
4. **Network Diagnostics Integration**:
    - Perform ping tests and display VM details.
5. **Scalability Testing**: Conduct load testing to assess performance under increased traffic.

### Conclusion

CloudBridge demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multiple cloud environments securely and efficiently. By bridging Azure and AWS, organizations can enhance their collaborative capabilities without the complexities and costs associated with full cloud migration.
